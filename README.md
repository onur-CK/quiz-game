## User Experience (UX)

Quickz is a website that tests user's general knowledge and create some fun time for the user at the same time.

### User Stories

I wanted to use a simple design to make it user friendly.It is ready to go just after entering a username and clicking submit.I think about creating difficulty modes with different timebounds to questions.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I decided to use eye catching colors and also keep the readability high at the same time to not cause it to tire the user's eyes.

![colors](https://github.com/onur-CK/pp1reviews/assets/118271710/3744b18e-e18b-4d61-b941-bd683f65c92a)

### Typography

I chose this font-family beacuse i found it easy to read and have a nice look at the same time.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

### Imagery

For now i dont think about including images.Maybe in the future i can add some questions with images, so user can answer by clicking the images.

### Wireframes

![wireframe](https://github.com/onur-CK/pp1reviews/assets/118271710/a4a8eb07-0732-41e5-8d1b-07487e02a224)

## Features

* This website only one main page guides you through answering questions.
* Question and answers window shown once user submits after entering a username.
* Rules window is shown when rules button is clicked.

### General features

* There are 10 random questions shown along the game out of 40 questions.
* Rules are shown when user clicks the rules button.
* We have a little window to track the current questions number.(1/10)
* We save the progress and username to display a result information at the end of the game.


### Future Implementations

* Difficulties options.
* To fix the present timer bug.
* To track answered correct and incorrect answers simultaneously.
* To add more questions with different categories.
* To add questions and answer options with images.

### Accessibility

* Tried to keep the design user friendly.
* Targeted to not have anything complex.
* Used only one page to guide the user through the all futures.
* Used different colors to make everything easier for user.

4. Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
5. In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
6. Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing

Testing was always there along the entire project build.I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along. 
I had problem with the timer function and i couldnt fix it.It goes too fast and doesnt refresh just after going to next question.But i didnt delete this function completely to be able to fix and use in the future.
I tested all the html and css files.They all work fine.
I tested my js file and i had 40 warnings with the same "These variables and syntaxs available in ES6".And i fixed it by creating a settins.json file with {"jshint.options": {"esversion": 6}}.
